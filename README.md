The missing collaboration layer for AI coding agents — unified skills and workflows for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and OpenCode.

**Semi-automated programming, powered by AI agents.** Define a requirement, let AI handle analysis, planning, coding, review, and delivery — you only step in when it matters.

## Why agent-infra?

Teams increasingly mix Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, and other AI TUIs in the same repository, but each tool tends to introduce its own commands, prompts, and local conventions. Without a shared layer, the result is fragmented workflows, duplicated setup, and task history that is difficult to audit.

agent-infra standardizes that collaboration surface. It gives every supported AI TUI the same task lifecycle, the same skill vocabulary, the same project governance files, and the same upgrade path, so teams can switch tools without rebuilding process from scratch.

<a id="see-it-in-action"></a>

## See it in Action

**Scenario**: Issue #42 reports *"Login API returns 500 when email contains a plus sign"*. Here is the full fix lifecycle — AI does the heavy lifting, you stay in control:

```bash
/import-issue 42
```

> AI reads the issue, creates `TASK-20260319-100000`, and extracts requirements.

```bash
/analyze-task TASK-20260319-100000
```

> AI scans the codebase, identifies `src/auth/login.ts` as the root cause, and writes `analysis.md`.

```bash
/plan-task TASK-20260319-100000
```

> AI proposes a fix plan: *"Sanitize the email input in `LoginService.validate()` and add a dedicated unit test."*
>
> **You review the plan and reply in natural language:**

```
The plan looks right, but don't change the DB schema.
Just fix it at the application layer in LoginService.
```

> AI updates the plan accordingly and confirms.

```bash
/implement-task TASK-20260319-100000
```

> AI writes the fix, adds a test case for `user+tag@example.com`, and runs all tests — green.

```bash
/review-task TASK-20260319-100000
```

> AI reviews its own implementation: *"Approved. 0 blockers, 0 major, 1 minor (missing JSDoc)."*

```bash
/refine-task TASK-20260319-100000
```

> AI fixes the minor issue and re-validates.

```bash
/commit
/create-pr
/complete-task TASK-20260319-100000
```

> Commit created, PR #43 opened (auto-linked to issue #42), task archived.

**9 commands. 1 natural-language correction. From issue to merged PR.** That is the entire SOP — programming can have a standard operating procedure too.

Every command above works the same way in Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and OpenCode. Switch tools mid-task — the workflow state follows.

### What each skill does behind the scenes

These are not thin command aliases. Each skill encapsulates standardized processes that are tedious and error-prone when done by hand:

- **Structured artifacts** — every step produces a templated document (`analysis.md`, `plan.md`, `review.md`) with consistent structure, not free-form notes
- **Multi-round versioning** — requirements changed? Run `analyze-task` again to get `analysis-r2.md`; the full revision history is preserved
- **Severity-classified reviews** — `review-task` categorizes findings into Blocker / Major / Minor with file paths and fix suggestions, not a vague "looks good"
- **Cross-tool state continuity** — `task.md` records who did what and when; Claude can analyze, Codex can implement, Gemini can review — context transfers seamlessly
- **Audit trail and co-authorship** — every step appends to the Activity Log; the final commit includes `Co-Authored-By` lines for all participating AI agents

<a id="key-features"></a>

## Key Features

- **Multi-AI collaboration**: one shared operating model for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and OpenCode
- **Bootstrap CLI + skill-driven execution**: initialize once, then let AI skills drive day-to-day work
- **Bilingual project docs**: English-first docs with synchronized Chinese translations
- **Template-source architecture**: `templates/` mirrors the rendered project structure
- **AI-assisted updates**: template changes can be merged while preserving project-specific customization

<a id="quick-start"></a>

## Quick Start

### 1. Install agent-infra

**Option A - npm (recommended)**

```bash
npm install -g @fitlab-ai/agent-infra
npx @fitlab-ai/agent-infra init
```

**Option B - Shell script**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fitlab-ai/agent-infra/main/install.sh | sh
```

**Option C - Install from source**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fitlab-ai/agent-infra.git
cd agent-infra
sh install.sh
```

### Updating agent-infra

Already installed? Update to the latest version using the same method you used to install:

**Option A - npm**

```bash
npm update -g @fitlab-ai/agent-infra
```

**Option B - Shell script**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fitlab-ai/agent-infra/main/install.sh | sh
```

**Option C - Install from source**

```bash
cd agent-infra
git pull
sh install.sh
```

Check your current version:

```bash
ai version
# or: agent-infra version
```

### 2. Initialize a new project

```bash
cd my-project
ai init
# or: agent-infra init
```

The CLI collects project metadata, installs the `update-agent-infra` seed command for all supported AI TUIs, and generates `.airc.json`.

> `ai` is a shorthand for `agent-infra`. Both commands are equivalent.

### 3. Render the full infrastructure

Open the project in any AI TUI and run `update-agent-infra`:

| TUI | Command |
|-----|---------|
| Claude Code | `/update-agent-infra` |
| Codex | `$update-agent-infra` |
| Gemini CLI | `/{{project}}:update-agent-infra` |
| OpenCode | `/update-agent-infra` |

This pulls the latest templates and renders all managed files. The same command is used both for first-time setup and for future template upgrades.

<a id="architecture-overview"></a>

## Architecture Overview

agent-infra is intentionally simple: a bootstrap CLI creates the seed configuration, then AI skills and workflows take over.

### End-to-End Flow

1. **Install** — `npm install -g @fitlab-ai/agent-infra` (or use the shell script)
2. **Initialize** — `ai init` in the project root to generate `.airc.json` and install the seed command
3. **Render** — run `update-agent-infra` in any AI TUI to pull templates and generate all managed files
4. **Develop** — use 28 built-in skills to drive the full lifecycle: `analysis → design → implementation → review → fix → commit`
5. **Update** — run `update-agent-infra` again whenever a new template version is available

GitHub renders Mermaid diagrams natively. If a downstream renderer does not, the text above still explains the system structure.

<a id="prebuilt-workflows"></a>

## Prebuilt Workflows

agent-infra includes **4 prebuilt workflows**. Three of them share the same gated delivery lifecycle:

`analysis -> design -> implementation -> review -> fix -> commit`

The fourth, `code-review`, is intentionally smaller and optimized for reviewing an existing PR or branch.

| Workflow | Best for | Step chain |
|----------|----------|------------|
| `feature-development` | Building a new feature or capability | `analysis -> design -> implementation -> review -> fix -> commit` |
| `bug-fix` | Diagnosing and fixing a defect with regression coverage | `analysis -> design -> implementation -> review -> fix -> commit` |
| `refactoring` | Structural changes that should preserve behavior | `analysis -> design -> implementation -> review -> fix -> commit` |
| `code-review` | Reviewing an existing PR or branch | `analysis -> review -> report` |

### Example lifecycle

The simplest end-to-end delivery loop looks like this:

```text
import-issue #42                    Import task from GitHub Issue
(or: create-task "add dark mode")   Or create a task from a description
         |
         |  --> get task ID, e.g. T1
         v
  analyze-task T1                   Requirement analysis
         |
         v
    plan-task T1                    Design solution  <-- human review
         |
         v
  implement-task T1                 Write code and tests
         |
         v
  +-> review-task T1                Automated code review
  |      |
  |   Issues?
  |      +--NO-------+
  |     YES          |
  |      |           |
  |      v           |
  |  refine-task T1  |
  |      |           |
  +------+           |
                     |
         +-----------+
         |
         v
      commit                        Commit final code
         |
         v
  complete-task T1                  Archive and finish
```

<a id="configuration-reference"></a>

## Configuration Reference

The generated `.airc.json` file is the central contract between the bootstrap CLI, templates, and future updates.

### Example `.airc.json`

```json
{
  "project": "my-project",
  "org": "my-org",
  "language": "en",
  "templateSource": "templates/",
  "templateVersion": "v0.3.1",
  "modules": ["ai", "github"],
  "files": {
    "managed": [
      ".agents/skills/",
      ".agents/templates/",
      ".agents/workflows/",
      ".claude/commands/",
      ".gemini/commands/",
      ".opencode/commands/"
    ],
    "merged": [
      ".agents/README.md",
      ".gitignore",
      "AGENTS.md",
      "CONTRIBUTING.md",
      "SECURITY.md"
    ],
    "ejected": []
  }
}
```

### Field reference

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `project` | Project name used when rendering commands, paths, and templates. |
| `org` | GitHub organization or owner used by generated metadata and links. |
| `language` | Primary project language or locale used by rendered templates. |
| `templateSource` | Local template root used during rendering. |
| `templateVersion` | Installed template version for future upgrades and drift tracking. |
| `modules` | Enabled template bundles. Supported values are `ai` and `github`. |
| `files` | Per-path update strategy configuration for managed, merged, and ejected files. |

### Module reference

| Module | Includes |
|--------|----------|
| `ai` | `.agents/`, `.claude/`, `.gemini/`, `.opencode/`, `AGENTS.md`, and related collaboration assets |
| `github` | `.github/`, contribution templates, release config, and GitHub governance assets |

<a id="file-management-strategies"></a>

## File Management Strategies

Each generated path is assigned an update strategy. That strategy determines how `update-agent-infra` treats the file later.

| Strategy | Meaning | Update behavior |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| **managed** | agent-infra fully controls the file | Re-rendered and overwritten on update |
| **merged** | Template content and user customizations coexist | AI-assisted merge preserves local additions where possible |
| **ejected** | Generated once and then owned by the project | Never touched again by future updates |

### Example strategy configuration

```json
{
  "files": {
    "managed": [
      ".agents/skills/",
      ".github/workflows/pr-title-check.yml"
    ],
    "merged": [
      ".gitignore",
      "AGENTS.md",
      "CONTRIBUTING.md"
    ],
    "ejected": [
      "SECURITY.md"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Moving a file from `managed` to `ejected`

1. Remove the path from the `managed` array in `.airc.json`.
2. Add the same path to the `ejected` array.
3. Run `update-agent-infra` again so future updates stop managing that file.

Use this when a file starts as template-owned but later becomes project-specific enough that automatic updates would create more noise than value.

<a id="version-management"></a>

## Version Management

agent-infra uses semantic versioning through Git tags and GitHub releases. The installed template version is recorded in `.airc.json` as `templateVersion`, which gives both humans and AI tools a stable reference point for upgrades.
