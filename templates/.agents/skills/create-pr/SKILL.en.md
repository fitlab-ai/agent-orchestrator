# Create Pull Request

Create a Pull Request and, when task-related, sync the essential metadata and reviewer summary immediately.

## Execution Flow

### 1. Parse Command Arguments

Identify arguments from the command input:
- arguments matching `TASK-{yyyyMMdd-HHmmss}` -> `{task-id}`
- remaining arguments -> `{target-branch}`

If `{task-id}` is provided, read `.agents/workspace/active/{task-id}/task.md` to load task metadata such as `issue_number` and `type`.
If `{task-id}` is omitted, try to resolve it from the current session context; if it still cannot be determined, skip task-association logic in later steps.

### 2. Determine the Target Branch

Use the explicit argument when provided. Otherwise infer the target branch from Git history and branch topology.

> Detailed branch detection rules live in `reference/branch-strategy.md`. Read `reference/branch-strategy.md` before auto-detecting the base branch.

### 3. Prepare the PR Body

Read `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` when it exists, review recent merged PRs for style, and gather all commits between `<target-branch>` and `HEAD`.

> Template handling, HEREDOC body generation, and `Generated with AI assistance` requirements live in `reference/pr-body-template.md`. Read `reference/pr-body-template.md` before writing the PR body.

### 4. Check Remote Branch State

Confirm whether the current branch already has an upstream. Push with `git push -u origin <current-branch>` when required.

### 5. Create the PR

Check whether the current branch already has a PR first; if one exists, show the PR URL and stop without repeating metadata sync or summary publication.

Read `.agents/rules/issue-pr-commands.md` before this step, then create the PR with its "Create a PR" command template.

If `{task-id}` is available and the related task provides `issue_number`, keep `Closes #{issue-number}` in the PR body.

### 6. Sync PR Metadata

For PRs where `{task-id}` is available, sync the core metadata immediately:
- query standard labels, Issue metadata, and PR metadata via `.agents/rules/issue-pr-commands.md`
- add the mapped type label and relevant `in:` labels with the PR update command from `.agents/rules/issue-pr-commands.md`
- sync the linked Issue `in:` labels to match by following the `in:` label sync rule in `.agents/rules/issue-sync.md`
- reuse the Issue milestone by following "Phase 3: `create-pr`" in `.agents/rules/milestone-inference.md`
- keep Development linking in the PR body with `Closes #{issue-number}` when applicable

### 7. Publish the Review Summary

Read the latest context artifacts when they exist: `plan.md` / `plan-r{N}.md`, `implementation.md` / `implementation-r{N}.md`, `review.md` / `review-r{N}.md`, and `refinement.md` / `refinement-r{N}.md`.

Aggregate a reviewer-facing summary from those artifacts and maintain a single idempotent summary comment via the hidden marker.

> Hidden marker handling, idempotent summary updates, review-history structure, and comment creation/update rules live in `reference/comment-publish.md` (which in turn points to `.agents/rules/pr-sync.md`). Read `reference/comment-publish.md` before publishing the summary.
>
> **Shell safety rules** (required before publishing the comment):
> 1. Replace `{comment-body}` with the actual inline text. Read files first, then paste the full content into the heredoc body. Do **not** use `$(cat ...)`, `$(< ...)`, `$(...)`, or `${...}` inside `<<'EOF'`.
> 2. Do **not** use `echo` when constructing strings that contain `<!-- -->`. Use `cat <<'EOF'` heredoc or `printf '%s\n'` instead.
> 3. The same constraints are restated in `.agents/rules/pr-sync.md`; once that rule is loaded, do not duplicate another copy of the template rules.

### 8. Update Task Status

Get the current time:

```bash
date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
```

If `{task-id}` is available, update task.md with `pr_number`, `updated_at`, and append the PR Created Activity Log entry including metadata-sync and summary results.

### 9. Verification Gate

If this operation is associated with `{task-id}`, run the verification gate to confirm task metadata and sync state. If there is no task context, skip this step.

```bash
node .agents/scripts/validate-artifact.js gate create-pr .agents/workspace/active/{task-id} --format text
```

Handle the result as follows:
- exit code 0 (all checks passed) -> continue to the "Inform User" step
- exit code 1 (validation failed) -> fix the reported issues and run the gate again
- exit code 2 (network blocked) -> stop and tell the user that human intervention is required

Keep the gate output in your reply as fresh evidence. Do not claim completion without output from this run.

### 10. Inform User

> Execute this step only after the verification gate passes.

> **IMPORTANT**: All TUI command formats listed below must be output in full. Do not show only the format for the current AI agent.

Explain the created PR URL, summarize metadata sync and summary-comment results, and recommend `complete-task {task-id}` once the workflow is truly done.

## Notes

- Review every commit in the branch, not only the latest one
- `create-pr` must not defer type-label mapping to another skill; inline the mapping here when `{task-id}` is available
- Keep the hidden summary marker as `<!-- sync-pr:{task-id}:summary -->` for compatibility with existing PR comments
- If the current branch already has a PR, show its URL and stop without repeating sync work
- When metadata inheritance from the Issue fails, continue with task.md and branch-based fallbacks

## Error Handling

- No commits found between `{target}` and `HEAD`
- Push rejected: suggest `git pull --rebase`
- Existing PR found: show the current PR URL and stop
- Inaccessible Issue metadata: skip inheritance and continue
