## Structure

```

## Command Format

Each command file uses Markdown with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown

Step-by-step instructions for the AI agent.
Use `!` prefix for shell commands that should be executed directly.
Use markdown code blocks for illustrative examples that should NOT be auto-executed.
```
